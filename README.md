# Encounters-of-Void

I am one of those people who played a lot of Pen and Papers. Often, I have played also encounter heavy ones. Some years ago I started to program a tool in a "chilled" manner to manage my encounters. This should change now. This project will implement a tool for managing sessions and their encounters fast and agile.
